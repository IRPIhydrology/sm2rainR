Description: Implementation of SM2RAIN algorithm in R: Estimation of Precipitation using Soil Moisture data. 
        SM2RAIN is a simple algorithm for estimating rainfall from soil moisture data. 
        If you do not believe it is possible, try yourself! 
        The description of SM2RAIN and of its performance can be found in:
